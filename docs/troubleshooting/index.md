Historical observations are version-scoped. Diagnose before applying a workaround. Do not store device codes, authorization URLs containing parameters, tokens or auth files.

Evidence identifiers refer to preserved TRACE Lab historical documents, not runtime dependencies of this setup. These records summarize those documents without copying raw authentication or run outputs.
