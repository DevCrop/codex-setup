# Optional model profiles

The user chooses the parent model and effort. TRACE does not auto-switch models or claim a measured model ranking. The optional CLI presets are `sol` (GPT-6.1 Sol medium), `astra` (Astra medium), and `astra-deep` (Astra high). Select with `codex --profile sol`; profiles do not select the app composer model or overwrite existing base choices.

Official guidance recommends GPT-6.1 Sol for complex coding when available, keeping Astra for the most demanding work. Start with the client's default effort and adjust for the task; Medium here is a convenience preset, not a measured optimum. Light/Low suits scoped tasks. Higher effort can increase time and tokens. Credit rates do not establish exact included-subscription savings. Standard speed remains the economical starting point; Fast consumes included usage at a higher rate. Do not silently lower checks or change effort after repeated failures.

Check host model availability before using a preset; report unsupported choices rather than silently substituting. Subagents inherit resolved parent settings unless an explicit spawn value, agents default, or custom-agent configuration overrides them. Inspect existing overrides during migration.
